A discussion forum for local topics


This is an experiment at creating a purely PHP (no frameworks) 
discussion forum with topics sorted by tags alone and threads 
stored by the location of the visitor for local conversations.

I may take a long time to get this completed since it's in my 
free time, however I will try to make incremental improvements 
over time.
